# Power Indices
This repository contains a Python implementation for calculating power indices, which are commonly used in voting theory and political science to measure the influence or "power" of individual members in decision-making bodies (such as voters in a weighted voting system). The power indices computed include:

- Shapley-Shubik Index
- (normalized) Banzhaf Index
- Deegan-Packel Index
